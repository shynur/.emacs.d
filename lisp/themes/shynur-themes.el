;; See (info "(emacs) Custom Themes")
;;
;;      Setting or saving Custom themes actually works by customizing
;;   ‘custom-enabled-themes’.  Its value is a list of Custom theme
;;   names (as Lisp symbols, e.g., ‘tango’).
;;
;;      If settings from two different themes overlap, the theme occurring
;;   earlier in ‘custom-enabled-themes’ takes precedence.
;;
;;      You can enable a specific Custom theme by typing [M-x ‘load-theme’].
;;   This prompts for a theme name, _loads_ the theme from the theme file,
;;   and _enables_ it.  If a theme file has been loaded before, you can
;;   enable the theme without loading its file by typing [M-x ‘enable-theme’].
;;   To disable a Custom theme, type [M-x ‘disable-theme’].
